# Medical-Analysis


#### The project is in the process of being completely uploaded, thank you for your patience :)    
#### Exciting!

I programmed a Python project to demonstrate the use of the Pandas Python library (Series, DataFrames), and Nimpy to analyze existing medical data.

Program utilizes:
◉ Data Structure Slicing/Selection
◉ Creating Serie/Data Frame objects
◉ Using High-Order and Built-In Panda functions
◉ Serie and DataFrame conversions
◉ Delimiter: separator of content while parsing a file --> regex
◉ Headers: data file --> row numbers
◉ Name: array --> data file --> column names
◉ Row Number Count: number of lines to read in the data file


Program functionalities:
◉ Accessing, Altering, Manipulating, and Searching Serie/Data Frame contents
◉ Standardizes the entire data collection use of data statistical values
